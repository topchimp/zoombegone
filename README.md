# zoombegone

ZoomBeGone is a Chrome extension that automatically closes the tab that chrome opens when you click on a calendar invite with a zoom link saving you from having to close it manually. That's it.
## Installation

* Edit the background.js and change the url to your company zoom url from yourcompanyname.zoom.us. In the most recent zoom update, it looks like they have updated the url to just zoom.us (no company prefix), so just check your url first.
* Either pack it yourself or load as an unpacked extension 

See the 'Loading an unpacked extension' section here [Chrome Extensions Development] (https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/)

## Usage

You'll see a coffee cup style icon on chrome and you can enable/disable manually
